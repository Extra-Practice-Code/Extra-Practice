          <h2>The Big Table</h2>
          <h3>Wood, screws, IKEA manual</h3>
          <p>When Gijs moved, around the same time as we moved into this space, he didn’t know what to do with his big table (same model as the desks in his art school). So we adopted it. This Big Table probably became the most used piece of furniture. It’s a lunch table, meeting table, radio table, salad bar, stage, workbench, temporary work spot, dinner table (with a cloth), presentation table, occasional seat, flower vase pedestal, mail collector, waiting room, jam station holding all of our small synths together.</p>

          <h2>The Cushions</h2>
          <h3>Left-over foam, left-over felt, velcro</h3>
          <p>Something was missing. We recreated our treasured art school classroom but it didn’t quite feel like one. You come in silently because someone is on a call, open your laptop, look at your mail, reply with – wait this feels like, well, an office. Part of that is the reality of living in precarity and the need to do moneywork. Another part is that the space was quite encouraging for that kind of work. Not for rest, play, read, chat, snack, hang. Thus, soft surfaces!</p>
